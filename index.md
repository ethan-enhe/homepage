## About Me

Hello, I'm Zhaienhe Zhou, a third-year bachelor's student majoring in Computer Science at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). My research interests lie in theoretical computer science, particularly randomized algorithms and graph theory.

I recently qualified for the **2024 ICPC World Finals** and achieved **14th place** in the competition, solving the same number of problems as the 12th place bronze medal team. In addition to competitive programming, I have been involved in several research projects under the supervision of distinguished professors.

## Research Interests

My primary research areas include:
- Randomized algorithms
- Graph theory

## Research Projects

- **Improved decoding of Tanner codes** (in preparation)  
  Advisor: Prof. Zeyu Guo  
  Presented improved algorithms for decoding Tanner codes and investigating previous work on expander codes and insertion-deletion codes.

- **Algorithms for sparse LPN and LSPN against low-noise** (in preparation)  
  Advisor: Prof. Xue Chen, with Wenxuan Shu  
  Developed improved algorithms in low-noise and high-noise settings. [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19215)

- **Expansion on Regular Graph** (2023.9 – 2024.1)  
  Advisor: Prof. Xue Chen  
  Investigated methods for establishing lower bounds on graph expansions using the second eigenvalue method and the girth method, with an exploration of potential enhancements to the girth method.

## Honors and Awards

- **ICPC 2024 World Finals**: Highest Honor, 14th place (solved the same number of problems as the 12th place bronze medal team).
- **Gold Medal**, 14th place in the 2023 ICPC Asia-East Continent Final.
- **Gold Medal**, 6th place in the 2023 ICPC Asia Hangzhou Regional Contest.
