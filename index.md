## About Me

Hello, I'm Zhaienhe Zhou, a second-year bachelor's student majoring in Computer Science at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), School of the Gifted Young. I'm also enrolled in the Talent Program in Computer Science (Yingcai Class).

My interests lie in theoretical computer science and I'm currently supervised by Prof. Xue Chen. I also participate in competitive programming, with achievements such as **ICPC 2024 World-Finalist (expected)**, and multiple awards in NOI, ICPC Regional Contests & East Continent Final, USACO, and Codeforces.

## Research Interests

I'm interested in theoretical computer science, including randomized algorithms, and graph theory.

## Research Projects

- Improved decoding of Tanner codes (in preparation) (with Prof. Zeyu Guo)
- Learning sparse parity with noise in linear samples (submitted) (with Prof. Xue Chen and Wenxuan Shu) [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19215)
- Expansion on Regular Graph (supervised by Prof. Xue Chen)

## Honors and Awards

- **Gold Medal, 14th place in the 2023 ICPC Asia-East Continent Final Contest.**
- Gold Medal, 6th place in the 2023 ICPC Asia Hangzhou Regional Contest.
- Silver Medal at the 2022 NOI-CCF Winter Camp.
- Bronze Medal in NOI 2021.
- Silver Medal in the 2020 Asia-Pacific Informatics Olympiad, China region.
- Second Prize in the National College Student Mathematics Competition, Non-Mathematics Category.
- Silver Scholarship, Talent Program Scholarship, Admission Scholarship.

## Teaching

- Teaching Assistant for Foundations of Algorithms at USTC, where I designed lab assignments and held weekly office hours.
- Competition Coach for the Winter 2024 Coding Course at TopsCoding, where I presented tutorials on string algorithms and number theory.
